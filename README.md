# Solar Power Estimator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run

First run 'npm install' from the root directory to install all dependancies.

You will also need to configure the .env file. If it does not exist, add a .env file to the root and define the variable "REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY" with your own Google API key. If you need one, I could provide one via email.

Then run 'npm start'.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
